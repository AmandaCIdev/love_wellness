### MoSCoW Prioritisation

We broke down user stories before prioritising and implementing them.
By following this method, we applied MoSCoW prioritisation and labels to our user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration
